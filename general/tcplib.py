# GENERIC DATA SENDING VIA SOCKET/CONNECTION
#############################################
"""
This is a simple generic data sending function.
It works with all data types (the receiver must 
know how to process it).

Arguments:

    socket: 
            socket of the destinator

    msg:  
            data packet you wish to send
"""

    # We prepend the pickled message with a fixed header 
    # which says how long the complete message is.
    # It's necessary because in a stream of data, you can't guess.
    data = bytes(f"{len(p_msg):<{HEADERSIZE}}", 'utf-8') + p_msg
